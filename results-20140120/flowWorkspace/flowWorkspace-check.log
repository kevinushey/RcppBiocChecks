Package in Depends field not imported from: ‘Rcpp’
  These packages need to be imported from for the case when
  this namespace is loaded but not attached.
Unexported objects imported by ‘:::’ calls:
  ‘flowCore:::checkClass’ ‘flowCore:::copyFlowSet’ ‘flowCore:::guid’
  ‘graph:::.makeEdgeKeys’ ‘lattice:::updateList’
  ‘ncdfFlow:::.isValidSamples’ ‘stats:::.splinefun’
  See the note in ?`:::` about the use of this operator.
There are ::: calls to the package's namespace in its code. A package
  almost never needs to use ::: for its own objects:
  ‘.getKeyword’ ‘.load_gs’ ‘.uuid_gen’ ‘trimWhiteSpace’
