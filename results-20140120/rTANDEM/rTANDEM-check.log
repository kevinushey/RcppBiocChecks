Package has both ‘src/Makevars.in’ and ‘src/Makevars’.
Installation with --no-configure' is unlikely to work.  If you intended
‘src/Makevars’ to be used on Windows, rename it to ‘src/Makevars.win’
otherwise remove it.  If ‘configure’ created ‘src/Makevars’, you need a
‘cleanup’ script.

File ‘/private/tmp/RcppDepends/rTANDEM.Rcheck/rTANDEM/libs/rTANDEM.so’:
  Found non-API call to R: ‘R_CStackLimit’

Compiled code should not call non-API entry points in R.
